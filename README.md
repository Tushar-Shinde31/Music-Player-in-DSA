# 🎵 DSA-Based C++ Music Player 🎶

## 📚 Overview

This project is a C++ music player that leverages **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to implement an efficient and dynamic playlist management system. It allows users to **add**, **delete**, **search**, and **play** songs, while also keeping track of **recently played** songs using a stack. The playlist is dynamically managed using **doubly linked lists** and includes persistent data storage using **file I/O operations**.

## 🚀 Features

- **🎶 Dynamic Playlist Management**: A **doubly linked list** is used to manage the playlist, allowing users to add, delete, search, and play songs.
- **💾 Persistent Playlist Storage**: Songs are saved to and loaded from external files, ensuring data persistence between sessions.
- **⏪ Recently Played Tracking**: A **stack** data structure keeps track of recently played songs for quick access.
- **🔀 Sorted Playlist**: The playlist can be sorted based on user preferences.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **C++**: Main programming language
- **Data Structures**: Doubly Linked List, Stack
- **File I/O**: Used for saving and loading playlists
- **Sorting Algorithms**: For playlist order management
